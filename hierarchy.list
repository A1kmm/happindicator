# This list is the result of a copy-and-paste from the AppIndicator hierarchy
# html documentation. Deprecated widgets are uncommented. Some additional
# object have been defined at the end of the copied list.

# The Gtk prefix of every object is removed, the other prefixes are
# kept.  The indentation implies the object hierarchy. In case the
# type query function cannot be derived from the name or the type name
# is different, an alternative name and type query function can be
# specified by appending 'as typename, <query_func>'.  In case this
# function is not specified, the <name> is converted to
# gtk_<name'>_get_type where <name'> is <name> where each upperscore
# letter is converted to an underscore and lowerletter. The underscore
# is omitted if an upperscore letter preceeded: GtkHButtonBox ->
# gtk_hbutton_box_get_type. The generation of a type can be
# conditional by appending 'if <tag>'. Such types are only produces if
# --tag=<tag> is given on the command line of TypeGenerator.

# Before these conditions, two additional properties may be given:
# * noDestr	: ignores the destructor given by the --destructor
#		  command line argument and uses 'objectUnref'
# * noEq	: do not make this type an instance of Eq; used
#		  if a different equality instance is manually
#		  defined later
